1.  "" + 1 + 0     =>  "10"       The first element is a string so + operator concatenates the rest to ""
2.  "" - 1 + 0     =>  -1         "" becomes 0 for completing subtraction
3.  true + false   =>  1          True is equal to 1 and False is equal to 0, so 1 + 0 becomes 1
4.  "2" * "3"      =>  6          JS automatically checks and finds that for multiplication "2" can be transformed to 2 and "3" to 3, so 2 * 3 = 6;
5.  4 + 5 + "px"   =>  "9px"      4 + 5 is 9, and 9 + "px" is concatenation, which is equal to "9px"
6.  "$" + 4 + 5    =>  "$45"      "$" is a string so + operator concatenates all three operands
7.  "4" - 2        =>  2          for subtraction "4" becomes 4 and 4 - 2 is 2
8.  "4px" - 2      =>  NaN        "4px" cannot transform to a number as that string contains letters, so the result is not a number
9.  7 / 0          =>  Infinity   7 is not divisible by 0 (mathematically), however JS considers 0 as an infinitely small and positive, so 7 divided by such a number goes to positive infinity
10. "-9" + 5       =>  "-95"      + acts as a concatenator as the first operand is a string, so we get "-95"
11. "-9" - 5       =>  -14        In order to complete subtraction, JS transforms "-9" to -9, so -9 - 5 is -14
12. null + 1       =>  1          null is a falsy value, and its numerical value is 0, so 0 + 1 is 1
13. undefined + 1  =>  NaN        any mathematical operation with undefined gives NaN, as undefined cannot be transformed to a numerical value
